# Dungeons

Design Ideas:
- Permanent split screen represents different time lines
- Each player is from one timeline or dimension (perhaps color coded?)
- Each color of player can only damage their respective colors of enemies
- Players have to jump between the splitscreens (timelines) to deal with the enemies that their coop partners can't deal with
- Players share a healthbar
- Players will receive items and upgrades in between levels to enhance their gameplay as the levels get progressively harder and harder
